Immediate comfort: Put on music that usually makes you feel good, take a warm shower or bath, or wrap yourself in something soft. Sometimes small physical comforts can provide a bit of relief when everything feels heavy.
Get moving: Even a short walk outside, some stretching, or dancing to one song can shift your energy. Movement helps process difficult emotions and often provides a small mood boost.

Connect with someone: Text or call a friend, family member, or anyone who cares about you. Sometimes just hearing another voice or sharing what you're going through can lighten the load.
Do something small for yourself: Make your favorite drink, watch funny videos, work on a puzzle, or do any small activity that usually brings you some joy.

Remember this feeling will pass: Desperation feels permanent when you're in it, but difficult emotions do shift and change. You've gotten through hard times before.
